mozutils
========

Some shell scripts I use for mozilla development:

    jsbuild:  builds javascript engine
    jstest:   runs javascript shell tests
    qwiggle:  runs wiggle on mercurial mq rejected patch pushes
    v8test:   a GC stress test: run the v8 benchmarks with GC zeal on in debugger
    mozbuild: builds the browser
